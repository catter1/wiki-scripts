# Wiki Scripts

This is an old project of mine from a half a year or so ago. Currently, it will not work out of the box, but most of what is needed is provided in the repo. It also imports my biome-color-grabber repo as a library, since it is necessary.

The main purpose of this is to try and upload some of my older projects to GitHub, just to get in the habit. In the future, I will be redoing this code in order to plug it into Incendy. For now, I shall upload it as the mess it is :)

Anyways, if for some reason you find it useful, enjoy!
